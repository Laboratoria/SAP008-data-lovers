        <span id="pokeEnfase">Pok√©mon turned 26 on February 27, 2022!</span> <span>üòç</span> And today 
        Pok√©<span id="lovers">LOVERS</span>is special, bringing 
        together a curiosity from Ash and Pikachu.<br />
        Confira abaixo. <br />
        <br />
        1. <span class="fontWeight">THE POK√âMON ANIME HAS 1131 EPISODES</span>,still in release, with a total of 23 western 
        seasons and 7 sagas in Japan!
        <br /><br />
        2. Of all these 1131 episodes so far, only <span class="fontWeight">ONE</span> Ash and Pikachu have not 
        appeared.
        <br /><br />
        3. Taking into account the main franchise, spin offs and even arcades and mobile games, there are more 
        than 120 Pok√©mon games, and we can expect more!
        <br /><br />
        4. <span class="fontWeight"> IN THE GAMES WE HAVE 891 POK√âMONS</span>, and more than a thousand if we consider alternative versions
        of the same creatures as
        the Alola and Galarian forms.
        <br /><br />
        5. <span class="fontWeight">ASH LOST </span> 6 leagues! He only won the Alola one, in addition to the orange 
        league and the border battle, which are 
        minor.
        <br /><br />
        6. <span class="fontWeight">ASH HAD 3 VOICERS IN BRAZIL.</span> After voicing the character Ash for 18 
        F√°bio Lucindo was 
        replaced by Charles Emmanuel. At that time, not only he, but the entire cast was changed when the anime 
        stopped being dubbed in SP and started to gain voices in RJ. In 2020, after four seasons, Charles left 
        the character and Matheus Periss√© took over.
        <br /><br />
        7. <span class="fontWeight">CLEFAIRY WAS GOING TO BE THE FACE OF POK√âMON.</span> Originally Pikachu was not the Pok√©mon icon/mascot!
        This decision came later, as the producers thought he looked more like a mascot. In fact, in the Japanese manga, Clefairy is even able to speak.
        <br /><br />
        8. <span class="fontWeight">ILLUSIONIST URI GELLER SUE NINTENDO BECAUSE OF POK√âMON KADABRA.</span>
        When the series started to be successful, magician Uri Geller sued the creators over Kadabra, a psychic-type pokemon that bends spoons.
        In addition to the similarity of bending spoons like the illusionist, in Japanese, the Pok√©mon's name is Yungerer.
        20 years later he  <span class="fontWeight">FINALLY</span> dropped the lawsuit and gave Nintendo permission to use the character.
